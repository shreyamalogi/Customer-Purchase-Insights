### **Customer Purchase Insights Project** üõí

The **Customer Purchase Insights** project is an in-depth exploration and analysis of a customer purchase dataset, utilizing Python's powerful data analysis libraries. The project aimed to extract meaningful insights and trends from the data, which can be valuable for understanding customer behavior and guiding business decisions.

**1. Data Exploration** üîç
- **Objective:** Understand the structure and content of the dataset to inform further analysis.
- **Action:** The first step involved displaying the first and last 10 rows of the dataset to get an initial overview of the data. This was followed by confirming the data types for each column, ensuring that the dataset was correctly formatted for analysis.


**2. Data Integrity Check** ‚úÖ
- **Objective:** Ensure the dataset is clean and reliable for analysis.
- **Action:** I detected and noted any null values present in the dataset, which could potentially skew the analysis if not handled appropriately. Additionally, I established the dataset's dimensions, determining the number of rows and columns to better understand its scope.


**3. Purchase Price Analysis** üí∞
- **Objective:** Analyze the distribution and central tendencies of purchase prices to uncover spending patterns.
- **Action:** I identified the range of purchase prices by locating the highest and lowest values, providing insight into the spectrum of customer spending. Furthermore, I calculated the mean purchase price, offering a summary statistic that represents the average spending behavior of customers.


**4. Demographic Insights** üåç
- **Objective:** Gain insights into the demographic characteristics of the customer base.
- **Action:** By determining the frequency of French language users in the dataset, I was able to segment the customer base based on language preference. This insight is valuable for tailoring marketing strategies and communications.


**5. Job Title Analysis** üßë‚Äçüíº
- **Objective:** Identify specific professional segments within the customer base.
- **Action:** I flagged job titles containing the word 'Engineer', highlighting a potentially significant demographic within the dataset. This analysis helps in understanding the professional background of customers and could be useful for targeted marketing.


**6. Security and Fraud Prevention** üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
- **Objective:** Enhance data security and prevent fraudulent activities.
- **Action:** I located the email associated with a specified IP address, which could be crucial for tracking customer activity and ensuring security. Additionally, I identified Mastercard users who made purchases exceeding $50, which could be flagged for review as part of fraud prevention measures.
- **Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas

**Overall Tech Stack**:
- **Data Manipulation:** Pandas
- **Programming Language:** Python

This project showcases my ability to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python, with a focus on extracting actionable insights from customer data. By systematically analyzing and interpreting the data, I provided a comprehensive understanding of customer behavior, demographic trends, and potential security concerns, demonstrating my proficiency in data-driven decision-making.
